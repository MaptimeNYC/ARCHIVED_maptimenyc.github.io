## It's All About You (Hack Night) at Mapzen

We had a terrific turn out for last night's Maptime-NYC: 18 mappers came out to either hack on their personal projects, help out others or just learn a new thing or two about mapping and geo. The space and atmosphere provided by [Mapzen](http://mapzen.com/) was absolutely terrific. Special thanks to Dan for prepping the room for us and to Harish and Randy for hanging out with us to assist other mappers.

There was a wide range of topics that people came to learn about or hack on including:

* D3 JS
* Spatial Analysis
* Georeferencing and tiling historical maps
* Geocoding with open-data
* Leaflet JS
* QGIS
* CartoDB

A few notable projects had to do with proportionally mapping the area of Israeli settlements in Jerusalem to fictional settlements in the area of Washington D.C.; performing a suitability-analysis of potential areas for fracking in New York state based on locations of existing fracking wells in Pennsylvania; looking at library usage data by zipcode in San Antonio, Texas; and thematically mapping types of historical buildings in NYC using building data from NYC PLUTO data. 

## Take Aways For Next Time
It seems we had a good amount of questions on spatial analysis with QGIS. This is one area where our current organizers lack a lot of experience. If you have any interest in helping out in this area for a future Maptime-NYC meetup please contact us!
