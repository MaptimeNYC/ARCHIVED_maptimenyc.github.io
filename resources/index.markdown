title: Maptime NYC: Resources!
---

The awesome thing about Maptime is there's like, a million amazing resources for learning about mapping and maps. The awesome thing about working on mapping stuff in New York is that there's also a ton of data resources for maps. Here's a list of both things!

##Useful NYC-Specific Resources 
- [Bytes of the Big Apple](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/bytes/applbyte.shtml): Run by NYC's Department of City Planning, it mostly has a lot of the same datasets you can find on the Open Data Portal but usually has more detailed metadata for its datasets. This is where you can download [MapPLUTO](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/bytes/dwn_pluto_mappluto.shtml#mappluto)! And [historical MapPLUTO](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/bytes/archive_pluto_mappluto.shtml)!

- [NYC Open Data Portal](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/): The City of New York's Official open data portal--has a ton of datasets, some of which are honestly more useful than others. Disadvantages: usually limited metadata, harder to get context for a given dataset. Honestly, I tend to go to this site as a last resort. 

- [ACRIS](http://a836-acris.nyc.gov/CP/): also known as the Automated City Register Information System (ACRIS). A kind of clumsy to use resource for a deeper dive on real estate data for specific properties. Like all portals, it makes you kind of die inside, but it means well. 

- [The one MTA subway map shapefile that, pretty much, everyone ends up finding via Google](http://spatialityblog.com/2010/07/08/mta-gis-data-update/). This was made by Steve Romulewski. All hail Steve. 

- [BetaNYC's Github](https://github.com/betanyc): BetaNYC is the local Code for America brigade and a gathering place, sometimes, for useful datasets that might not be easily or immediately found on the city's open data portal. 

- [MTA Developer Resources](http://web.mta.info/developers/): Pretty much what it sounds like. There's a variety of [real-time and static data feeds](http://web.mta.info/developers/developer-data-terms.html#data) including GTFS Schedule Data, bus and subway times, fare data, subway entry and exit spatial data, and turnstile usage data. 

- [NYC Geoclient API](https://developer.cityofnewyork.us/api/geoclient-api): Also maintained by the Department of City Planning, the Geoclient API lets developers geocode using Geosupport, the city's in-house geocoder. 

- [NYS GIS Clearinghouse](https://gis.ny.gov/): It's what it sounds like. Honestly, I still find this site really overwhelming and confusing and would love to spend more time actually looking at what's even there. 

##Useful Mapping Resources: 
- I mean, we could just send you to the [Maptime website](http://www.maptime.io/lessons-resources/) as a start. 
- There's also this really great [list of tutorials](https://github.com/maptime/maptime/blob/master/tutorials.md) in the [Maptime github repository](https://github.com/maptime).
